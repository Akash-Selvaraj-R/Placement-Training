Qn1 can we achieve polymorphism without using inheritance in java?
No, polymorphism can be achieved without using inheritance in Java
Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass
It is achieved through method overriding and method overloading
Method overriding is the process of redefining a method in a subclass that has been overridden in the superclass
Method overloading is the process of defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class

Qn2 What is Dynamic dispatch?
Dynamic dispatch is the process of selecting the correct method to be executed at runtime 
based on the type of the object being referred to
It is achieved through method overriding and method dispatch
Method overriding is the process of redefining a method in a subclass that has been overridden in the superclass

Qn3 What is the difference between static and dynamic dispatch?
Static dispatch is the process of selecting the correct method to be executed
at compile time based on the type of the object being referred to
Dynamic dispatch is the process of selecting the correct method to be executed
at runtime based on the type of the object being
