INTERFACES

Qn. Is java support multiple inheritance?
Ans. No, Java does not support multiple inheritance
However, it does support interfaces, which can be used to achieve similar functionality

Qn. What is the difference between interface and abstract class?
Ans. An interface is a completely abstract class that contains only abstract methods and constants.
An abstract class is a class that contains both abstract and non-abstract methods.
An interface can be implemented by a class, while an abstract class can be extended by a class

Q3. a class can extend to  class
a class can implement a interface
a interface can extend to interface
then what is for interface to class?
Ans. A class can implement multiple interfaces, while an interface can extend other interfaces.

Q4. What is inheritance?
Ans. Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a class
to inherit properties and methods from another class
It enables code reusability

Q5. What is the difference between extends and implements?
Ans. The extends keyword is used to inherit properties and methods from a superclass
The implements keyword is used to implement an interface in a class

Q6. What is interface?
Ans. An interface is a completely abstract class that contains only abstract methods and constants.
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

Q7. Can an abstract class implement an interface? and how?
Ans. Yes, an abstract class can implement an interface
An abstract class can implement multiple interfaces
It is used to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.

Q8. Can an interface extend another interface? and how?
Ans. Yes, an interface can extend another interface
It is used to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java

Q9. is that possible to extend an interface from class?
Ans. No, it is not possible to extend an interface from a class
It is used to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.
