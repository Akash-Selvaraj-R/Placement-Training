/* define abstract class and abstract method with example.

abstract class is a class that has at least one abstract method
An abstract method is a method that does not have an implementation
It is declared with the abstract keyword.
An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly
It is meant to be subclassed by other classes that provide implementations for the abstract methods

example of abstract class
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound(); // abstract method
    void eat() { // concrete method
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}


Q2. Partial abstraction 
An abstract class can provide partial abstraction by having both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation)
This allows subclasses to inherit common behavior while also being required to implement specific behaviors defined by the abstract methods
example of partial abstraction
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area(); // abstract method
    void display() { // concrete method
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

Q3. why interface is different from abstract class in java
1. Multiple Inheritance: A class can implement multiple interfaces, but it can only extend one abstract class.
2. Method Implementation: An abstract class can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation)
 In contrast, interfaces (prior to Java 8) could only have abstract methods
 However, from Java 8 onwards, interfaces can also have default and static methods with implementations
3. Fields: An abstract class can have instance variables (fields) with different access modifiers (private, protected, public)
 In contrast, all fields in an interface are implicitly public, static, and final (constants)
4. Constructors: An abstract class can have constructors, which can be called when a subclass is instantiated
    In contrast, interfaces cannot have constructors because they cannot be instantiated directly
5. Access Modifiers: Abstract class methods can have various access modifiers (private, protected, public)
    In contrast, all methods in an interface are implicitly public
example of interface
interface Animal {
    void makeSound(); // abstract method
    void eat(); // abstract method
}
// Example implementation of the interface
class Dog implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof");
    }
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("The dog eats food.");
    }
}

Q4. Singleton class in java with example
A singleton class is a class that allows only one instance of itself to be created
It provides a global point of access to that instance
example of singleton class
class Singleton {   
    private static Singleton instance; // private static variable to hold the single instance

    // private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    private Singleton() {
    }

    // public static method to provide access to the instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton(); // create the instance if it doesn't exist
        }
        return instance; // return the single instance
    }
}

Q5. What is encapsulation in java?
Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP)
that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions)
that operate on that data into a single unit called a class
It is the process of hiding the internal details of a class and exposing only the necessary information to the outside world
This helps to protect the data from being modified or accessed in an unintended way
example of encapsulation
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // private variable to hold the account balance

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }
}

Q6. What is Getter and Setter methods in java?
Getter and setter methods are methods that provide access to the private fields of a class
They allow you to read (get) and modify (set) the values of the fields
Getter methods are used to retrieve the value of a field, while setter methods are used to modify the value of a field
