/* types of methods in java 
1. instance method
2. static method
3. user defined method
4. predefined method
5. parameterized method
6. non-parameterized method
a line definition for each method type:
1. Instance Method: A method that belongs to an instance of a class and can access instance variables.
2. Static Method: A method that belongs to the class itself and can be called without creating an instance of the class.
3. User Defined Method: A method that is created by the programmer to perform a specific task.
4. Predefined Method: A method that is provided by the Java API for common tasks, such as String methods.
5. Parameterized Method: A method that accepts parameters (arguments) to perform operations based on the input values.
6. Non-Parameterized Method: A method that does not accept any parameters and performs a specific task without any input.


//simple examples for java methods mentioned above and give me explanation for each example:

```java
public class Example {
    // Instance Method
    public void instanceMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is an instance method.");
    }

    // Static Method
    public static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }  
    // User Defined Method
    public void userDefinedMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a user defined method.");
    }
    // Predefined Method
    public void predefinedMethod() {
        String str = "Hello, World!";
        System.out.println("Length of the string is: " + str.length());
    }
    // Parameterized Method
    public void parameterizedMethod(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
    // Non-Parameterized Method
    public void nonParameterizedMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a non-parameterized method.");
    }
}


Qn.1 Tell me how static method is different from instance method in java?

A static method belongs to the class itself, not to any specific instance of the class
It can be called without creating an instance of the class
Static methods are often used for utility functions or methods that don't require any instance variables
They can only directly access other static members (variables or methods) of the class
example:
```java
public class StaticExample {
    public static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }
}
StaticExample.staticMethod(); // Calling static method without creating an instance
